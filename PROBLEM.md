Recently we met with a client who wants to create an e-commerce platform for his dropshipping business. The project seemed challenging, so we grabbed it. And as always, the client wanted a demo for the project. We decided to go with the checkout page including the payment method integrated with bKash.

For the frontend part, we chose react.js to work with and selected TailwindCSS for building a nice UI in a quick time.

And for the backend, we built a custom template on top of express.js, socket.io and, mongoose to cut off the development time so that, we the developers can focus on building the business logic and deliver a project quickly. So we decided to use that template. The template has hooks, event listeners & emitters, API handlers, db operations, and htp2 built-in.
But suddenly we were facing some issues with the project. Both the front-end & backend parts were not working properly. After deploying a working demo to our server. We lost all of the source codes & now only left with the build version of the project.
Our client wants a new feature to be implemented, so we restored some of the source codes. And that's all we are left with. We need your help debugging the source code we have so that we can implement the new feature and get a happy customer.

This documentation may help you with the payment integration part: https://developer.bka.sh/
